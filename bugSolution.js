```javascript
const query = { name: /pattern/i }; 
//This query will cause error if the name field contains a value that is not a string.
//For example, if the name field contains a number, the query will throw an error.
//This is because the regular expression cannot be applied to a number.
//This can be fixed by using $regex operator with $type operator to check the field type.
//In this case, we are using the $type operator to check if the name field is of type string.
//If the name field is of type string, then the regular expression will be applied.
//Otherwise, the query will return an empty array.

//This is a more robust query that will not throw an error if the name field contains a value that is not a string.
const query2 = {
  $expr: {
    $and: [
      { $eq: [{ $type: "$name" }, "string"] },
      { $regexMatch: { input: "$name", regex: /pattern/i } },
    ],
  },
};
